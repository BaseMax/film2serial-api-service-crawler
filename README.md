# film2serial API Service Crawler

film2serial-api-service-crawler

Run daily or every hours:

```
php importer.php
```

This crawler is designed to automatically update the database.
But this will require a **DataLife Engine** CMS. Something that is not available for free. (Free trial has limitation)

If you want to use a crawler without this CMS(DataLife). You can look at the [parser-test.php](parser-test.php) file.

### TODO

There is a problem with set categories for posts that I do not yet know the exact cause. But editing each category manually solves this to some extent.
